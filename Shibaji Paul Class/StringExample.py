# declare a variable str1 and assign "12" to it. Make sure that 12 is surrounded with double quotes, that is it should be represented as string.
# declare a variable named x and convert str1, that you declared above to integer using int function and assign the
# converted result into x.
# declare another variable str2 and assign "5.75" into it, "5.75" is a string.
# In the next line, declare a variable y and then convert and assign the content of str2 into y. str2 must be converted to
# float, you must use the float function.
# declare a variable z and assign sum of x and y to z.
# print the content of z into the console using print function.

str1 = "12"
